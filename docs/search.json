The summer school is funded by the Fund for the Promotion of Teaching of LMU Munich. The LMU University Library provides in-kind support."

Master students and early post docs are also welcome to apply. It will be held in a hybrid format and you will be able to choose your preferred mode of participation (online or in-person). By applying, we expect you to attend all sessions of the school (with exception possible).\nDuring the application process, you will be asked about your motivation and experience. We will prioritize novices with a clear ideas about where to integrate these news skills in their own research. At equal score, we will prioritize members of the LMU, and maximize the diversity of applicants background in terms of discipline, career stage, and gender.\nWe will not provide travel grants. The in-person part of the school will take place in UB der LMU - Fachbibliothek Philologicum, Ludwigstraße 25, 80539 München, Germany. The online part will be on Zoom."

    "text": "Uli Dirnagl: Reducing waste and increasing value of biomedical research\n Tuesday 12 September, 9:00-9:45\nRecent advances in biomedical research provide innumerable opportunities to develop novel preventive and therapeutic strategies. However, only a small fraction of biomedical discoveries are successfully translated into clinical applications. Potential ‘breakthrough’ therapies, which are spectacularly successful in animal models of disease, often fail in clinical trials. This translational bottleneck imposes burdens on research and healthcare systems, as well as patients who participate in trials of novel strategies. The high attrition rate of preclinical to clinical development may directly relate to concerns about the reliability and reproducibility of biomedical research. Apparently there are substantial weaknesses in planning, conducting, analysing, and reporting this research. Low internal and external validity as well as low statistical power in particular of preclinical research appears to produce a very high rate of false positives, and inflates effect sizes unrealistically. Not surprisingly then, the majority of scientists believe that we are in the midst of a ‘reproducibility crisis’. The immense proliferation in research outputs, combined with increasing methodological complexity and the size of data sets, greatly complicates the sharing, evaluation, and synthesis of high quality evidence. At the same time, nonpublication of results leads to duplicative research and deprives medical decision-makers of the totality of evidence. But how can we overcome this crisis?\nIn his presentation, Prof. Dr. Uli Dirnagl, Head of Department of Experimental Neurology at the Charité in Berlin, Co-founder and Director of the Center for Stroke Research Berlin, and Founding Director of the QUEST Center for Responsible Research at the Berlin Institute of Health, will present a set of behaviours, activities and research practices which present prime targets for improvement."

Refuting the view that there is no place for subjective attitudes in ‘objective science’, he will explain the value of convincing evidence in terms of a cycle of variations on the theme of representing rational degrees of belief by means of subjective probabilities (and changing them by Bayesian conditionalization). We will then discuss reforms of research methodology, which the open research movement proposes, in the context of such scientific reasoning."

    "text": "Richard McElreath: Science as amateur software development\n Wednesday 13 September, 9:00-9:45\nScience is one of humanity’s greatest inventions. Academia, on the other hand, is not. It is remarkable how successful science has been, given the often chaotic habits of scientists. In contrast to other fields, like say landscaping or software engineering, science as a profession is largely *unprofessional*—apprentice scientists are taught less about how to work responsibly than about how to earn promotions. This results in ubiquitous and costly errors. Software development has become indispensable to scientific work.\nProf. Dr. Richard McElreath, Director of the Department of Human Behavior, Ecology, and Culture at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, Leipzig, will playfully ask how software development can become even more useful by transferring some aspects of its professionalism, the day-to-day tracking and back-tracking and testing that is especially part of distributed, open-source software development. Science, after all, aspires to be distributed, open-source knowledge development."

Dr. Joachim Wuttke, Group Leader of Scientific Computing, Jülich Centre for Neutron Science, Garching, will present guidelines for collaborative development of sustainable data treatment software (https://doi.org/10.3233/JNR-220002). In software engineering, there is a common saying that “code is read by humans more than it is executed by computers”. Whether this is exactly true or not, one message remains: readability counts. This is even more so in research, as code is often the only available detailed description of the computational experiments of data analyses underlying your research. This lecture will cover simple techniques to make your codes easier to read - by yourself, your colleagues or your peers reproducing your research."

    "text": "Version control with Git with RStudio\nMalika Ihle, Felix Henninger, Pat Callahan\n  Wednesday 13 September, 13:15-16:15\nIn this facilitated self-paced tutorial, you will learn the basic concept of version control using RStudio as one of many possible GUI interfaces that can interact with Git. You will learn how to use version control for your own workflow (Git within RStudio with backup online on GitHub) and for collaborative coding (fork, clone, pull requests on Github). The self-paced tutorials can be found at: https://malikaihle.github.io/Introduction-RStudio-Git-GitHub/ and https://malikaihle.github.io/Collaborative-RStudio-GitHub/.\nDr Malika Ihle, LMU Open Science Center coordinator, Felix Henninger, PhD student in Statistics, and Pat Callahan, M.Sc. student in Epidemiology will co-facilitate this session."

In a nutshell, Quarto lets you mix text written in markdown with chunks of executable code written in, e.g., R or Python. You can use it for interactive notebooks, and export to a large number of formats including HTML, PDF/LaTeX, Microsoft Word or PowerPoint, or even interactive websites. In this workshop, we cover the fundamentals, including the markdown syntax, code chunks and inline code, and the output formats available. We also go over citations, cross-referencing, and templating, which ultimately allow you to write academic papers entirely in Quarto.\nA team of LMU psychologists will instruct this session: Dr Florian Pargent, and Dr Philipp Sckopke will create the material, and B.Sc. Florian Kohrt and Dipl.-Psych Lena Schiestel M.A. will facilitate the live session."
