### MCML Workshop Advanced Reproducibility

MCML and the Open Science Initiative in Statistics organise this workshop to allow early-career researchers to gain more trust in the research that they do, and make it as credible as it can be in the eyes of their peers, the public, and funding agencies.

By joining (or accessing the material after the school), you will learn how to:

-   plan your statistical plans in advance of collecting data to prevent biases in analyses, with the help of **preregistration** and **data simulation**;
-   create computationally reproducible workflows so you can be more efficient and spot mistakes in data wrangling or analyses, through **programming**, creating **dynamic reports**, and **version controlling** scripts;
-   share **data, materials, codes, and articles** appropriately (using **Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable principles**, sensible data **anonymisation techniques**, adequate **repositories** and **licences**) for your research to have more impact, by allowing others to build upon or replicate your work;
-   follow **guidelines to report results** adequately and conduct **systematic reviews**
